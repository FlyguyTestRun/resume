## Professional Summary
Systems Engineer and IT Consultant with **20 years of progressive experience** designing, administering, and modernizing enterprise systems, and high-impact support automation. My work  on transforming complex information ecosystems into secure, scalable solutions and AI-driven architectures that improve productivity, reduce redundancy and enhance decision making. 

I design and implement multi-agent workflows that support diagnostics, guided troubleshooting, and knowledge retrieval for technical teams, leveraging both proprietary and open-source models. This includes building MCP-based architectures (local and Cloud), engingeering company-grounded knowledge bases, developing validated data ingestion pipelines, and delivering structured metadata strategies that improve response accuracy and system trust. These efforts transform raw operational data into governed, searchable knowledge systems embedded within enterprise support workflows. 

At Trial IT Services, I have designed Microsoft environments across on-premises, hybrid, and cloud infrastructures. Experience in  Azure/Entra ID, Intune, Windows Server, virtualization, backup and recovery, and automation. Integrating AI-assisted systems, knowledge architectures, and automation frameworks to improve operational consistency, documentation quality, and decision support in enterprise and environments. I am recognized for technical leadership, system reliability, and disciplined execution in complex environments.
